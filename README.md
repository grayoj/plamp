# Plamp.

Can we create a LAMP (PLAMP) Parody? Documentation would be provided in soonest and some sections of the code requires updates and modifications. Particularly the dockerization, builds and handling of our dynamic php files.
The purpose of PLAMP is to build our own simple LAMP stack. We use Linux (ubuntu) as the base OS for the build, Apache Server (but no, it's a parody so we use our own server in C) MySQL? (Bro I don't know how to build a database engine, YET).
Then yes, we use PHP. This is all for fun. Off I go for some bug fixing and documenting. MIT Licensed btw.
